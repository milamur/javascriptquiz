This is my completed JavaScript Quiz assignment for WRA 410.

The questions I wrote for this quiz cover everything we've learned in this class including UNIX, HTML, CSS, Git, Ruby, Rails and JavaScript. I incorporated both short answer and multiple choice questions.

Questions include:

1. After making changes to a Rails application, what command should you run?
2. In Ruby on Rails, what does scaffolding do?
3. What is the controller’s responsibility in the MVC pattern?
4. In HTML and CSS, how do floats work?
5. What UNIX command creates a new file?
6. Which programming language is this: firstName = String.new("Jane")?
7. After typing in “git commit -m” in UNIX, what should you do next?
8. In Javascript, how do you create a loop that changes each string in an array so that they are plural?
9. In Ruby, how would you classify a string?
10. What does navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser do?

Correct answers include:

1. rake db:migrate
2. Automatically generates the models, views and controllers you need for a table
3. It accepts a request and dispatches a response from the Rails application
4. They push an element to the left/right and allow text to wrap around it
5. mkdir
6. Ruby
7. Explain the changes made to the file in quotes
8. for (let i = 0 ; i < string.length; i++) { strings[i] = strings[i] + 's'; }
9. method
10. It sends a request to the Rails server running locally on port 3000

As for the CSS, I changed the font to "Arvo" and the color scheme to a yellow (#FFF05F), pastel pinkish-red (#e08686) and pastel blue (#4682B4). I also changed the images that correspond with the results of the quiz to react pictures of cats. Lastly, I increased the width of the box containing quiz.
